<h1 id="pythonheader">Python Experience</h1>
<p id="pythonexperience">I started writing in Python 
    in March 2020. As you will be able to see below,
    I have experience with various different modules
    including discord.py, pygame, selenium, tkinter, openCV, JSON
    and flask. I also have experience in things such as
    object oriented programming, creating custom 
    python modules. I also have experience with working
    with databases in Python. As you continue through
    this site, you will be able to see experience that 
    I have of everything that is listed above. Scroll
    down to get started!
    <br><br> Note: To access GitHub repositories, you can click
    on the name of the projects.
</p>
<h2 id="discordpy">Discord.py</h2>
<p id="discordpyexperience">Discord.py was one of the first
    Python modules I ever used. The main reason I got into
    Python is because I wanted to make a discord bot. Ever since
    March 2020, I continued to learn more and more about discord.py
    and how it worked. Below, you can find some of the bots I have worked on
    as well as the GitHub repositories for them.

<a href="https://github.com/CarterHagans/supportbot">
<h3 id="bot1">Support Bot</h3>
</a>
<p id="bot1desc">This bot is to help servers with managing their support
    provided to their members. With this bot, you are able to create and 
    manage tickets. The features of ticket management include "react to open a ticket" message
    renaming the ticket, and closing the ticket. Although this is a simple ticket, 
    it allows for the easiest communication between a staff team and the members
    of a community. If you would like more information on this bot, feel free
    to ask!
</p>
<a href="https://github.com/CarterHagans/moderationbot">
<h3 id="bot2">Moderation Bot</h3>

</a>
<p id="bot2desc">This is a discord moderation bot. The bot has a numerous 
    amount of commands that can allow the staff team of a discord server to 
    efficiently take actions on a member if needed. Some of the commands, not all
    of them are the following: ban,kick,mute,tempmute,etc. This moderation bot
    does not come with the JSON file, although with bots with the JSON file, it has
    the ability to store warnings whereas the one without a JSON file does not. 
    If you would like more information on this bot, feel free to ask!
</p>
<p id="discordpyending">Although that there are only 2 bots listed, you are able
    to request a custom bot with whatever features you would like. If you would 
    like one of these bots with custom features, feel free to reach out!
</p>
<h2 id="pygame">Pygame</h2>
<img id="pygamelogo" src="{{ url_for('static',filename='Images/pygame.png') }}"/>
<p id="pygame_experience">I have only made one decently sized game in Pygame<
    which will be shown below. Pygame is still a relatively new module to me, starting
in March 2021. If you would like more specific information on my experience with pygame,
please feel free to reach out.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/CarterHagans/space-game">
<h3 id="game1">Spaceship Fight</h3>
</a>
<p id="game1desc">This game is where there are two spaceships and a border in the middle.
    The goal is to defeat the other spaceship by shooting it and not running out of health.
    There are powerups, such as +1 health, bombs, and shields. There are limited amounts of
    shields, and you can only shoot a certain number of bullets at a time. This game has console
    controller compatibility as well. If you would like more details on this game, feel free
    to let me know!
</p>
<h2 id="selenium">Selenium</h2>
<img id="seleniumlogo" src="{{ url_for('static',filename='Images/selenium.png') }}"/>
<p id="seleniumexperience">My experience in selenium is not that much in this current 
    point in time. I do not have any github repositories that I am able to showcase,
    however this may be updated in the future. I have only worked on small projects
    in selenium such as automating simple tasks such as logging in and posting things
    on social media. As my experience continues to grow in Selenium, it is possible
    that GitHub repositories will be posted here with the code of the selenium projects.
    If you want any additional information on my selenium experience, please feel free
    to reach out to me.
</p>
<h2 id="tkinter">Tkinter</h2>
<img id="tkinterlogo" src="{{ url_for('static',filename='Images/tkinter.png') }}"/>
<p id="tkinterexperience">I have a few projects that I have worked on in Tkinter.
    I am currently working on becoming more familar with this module, however I feel
    like I have a decent amount of experience with this module already. More projects
    will be added to the Tkinter section as I continue to work and learn more with this module.
</p>
<a href="https://github.com/CarterHagans/texteditor">
<h2 id="tkinter1">Text Editor</h2>
</a>
<p id="tkinter1desc">This is a very basic text editor created using Python's
    Tkinter module. It has basic feautres of saving files, loading files, and 
    a few other features. This text editor may be improved overtime depending
    on how much free time I have. If you have any questions or want to reach out
    to me about further inquires of this text editor, feel free to do so!
</p>

<h2 id="tkinter2">Fridge Assistant</h2>
<p id="tkinter2desc">This app is currently not complete, which means there is no
    GitHub repository currently available for this project, but there will be one
    released when the software is complete. For the fridge assitant, there will 
    be an option to view what is inside your fridge, add items to your shopping list,
    connect to a phone number, and have administration tools. There will also be a 
    web-based application of the Fridge Assistant which is currently in development 
    as well. If you have any questions or inquires of the tkinter version or the
    web-app version, feel free to ask! Below is a screenshot of the Tkinter Fridge
    Assistant.
